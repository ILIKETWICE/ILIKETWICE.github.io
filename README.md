# Linux Engginner's Blog

Hey, buddy, welcome here

I am a Linux engineer, currently learning Python, and this blog is a record of knowledge from my work experience

The main technical points in this blog include: Docker, K8S, Redis, Nginx, Interview

At present, the blog is in slow update, because most of my energy is placed on Python.

Well, that's it. Bye
